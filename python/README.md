Programming begins and ends with practice. 
So I have decided to try replit's 100 day coding challenge to build my skills. 
In this directory, I will be using python as my primary language.
The challenge started on the 28th of September 2022

**[day_1.py](https://github.com/B-Akapo/100-days_of_coding/blob/main/python/day_1.py)** - Using print() function.

**[day_2.py](https://github.com/B-Akapo/100-days_of_coding/blob/main/python/day_2.py)** - Getting input from user and using print() to print it out.

**[day_3.py](https://github.com/B-Akapo/100-days_of_coding/blob/main/python/day_3.py)** - Using print() to concatenate strings and variables.

**[day_4.py](https://github.com/B-Akapo/100-days_of_coding/blob/main/python/day_4.py)** - An adventure story where user inputs their choices.

**[day_5.py](https://github.com/B-Akapo/100-days_of_coding/blob/main/python/day_5.py)** - Code using if/else statement to see if a user is fit to be a lawyer
